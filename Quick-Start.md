## What Happens Next

### ‚úÖ **Automatic Sharing**
- His events from the cutoff date forward automatically appear in "Our Plans"
- Events show up as "Jamie: Dinner plans", "Jamie: Weekend trip", etc.
- Syncs every 4 hours automatically
- No more manual work needed

### üîí **Privacy Protected**
- You never get access to his full calendar
- His events before the cutoff date stay private
- Events marked "private" are never shared
- Events with "private" in the title are filtered out

### üì± **For You**
- Open Google Calendar and see "Our Plans"
- All his shared events appear there
- You can see them on phone/computer/anywhere
- No special apps needed

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Script function not found: doGet"
- Make sure you saved the OneClickSetup.gs file (Ctrl+S)
- The HTML file must be named exactly `setup` (not `setup.html`)
- Try running the doGet function once from the dropdown
- Make sure you're deploying a "New deployment" not updating an old one

### "Cannot access shared calendar"
- Make sure you shared the calendar with "Make changes to events" permission
- Double-check the calendar ID is correct
- Wait a few minutes for Google to propagate permissions

### "No events showing up"
- Check that events are after the cutoff date
- Make sure events aren't marked as "private"
- Events with "private" in the title are automatically filtered out

### "Want to change the cutoff date"
- Your boyfriend can re-run the web app setup with a new date
- Or edit the configuration in the Apps Script

---

## Advanced Options

### **Change Sync Frequency**
Default is every 4 hours. To change:
1. In Apps Script, go to "Triggers"
2. Delete existing trigger
3. Create new one with different frequency

### **Stop Sharing**
Your boyfriend can:
1. Go to Apps Script ‚Üí "Triggers"
2. Delete the sync trigger
3. Optionally run `stopSharing(true)` to remove already-shared events

### **Share Multiple Calendars**
The script now shows all his calendars in a dropdown - he can choose which one to share from (Personal, Work, etc.). To share from multiple calendars, he would need to run the setup multiple times with different calendar selections.
